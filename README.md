# AoC18
My solutions for advent of code 2018.

For these puzzles (and to a point also in general) I try to use as little 
external libraries and exotic patterns as possible while still writing 
well-performing and "readable" code.

If you see something that is hard to grasp (or plain bad), feel free to 
point it out via an issue, I'm always happy to get feedback, as long as
it's not worded too harshly.
